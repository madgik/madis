Installing Madis
================

The requirements for using Madis are:

1.  Python 2.6.x: You can download a windows distribution of Python from
    http://www.python.org/download/releases/ .You need to download the latest
    Python in the 2.6 series. Madis hasn't been tested at all with Python 3.x

    Most Linux distributions come with Python 2.6 preinstalled.

2.  Latest APSW version: You can download a windows distribution of APSW from
    http://code.google.com/p/apsw/downloads/list .

    Most Linux distributions ship with old versions of APSW, so for best results
    APSW should be build from source. The instructions for building APSW are in:

    http://apsw.googlecode.com/svn/publish/build.html

3.  Readline: This is needed only in Windows (most Linux distributions come with
    readline preinstalled). You'll find a Python readline for Windows in:

    http://newcenturycomputers.net/projects/readline.html

    Download from above page, the latest Readline-X.X.win32-py2.X.exe, and install it.

4.  Download the Madis archive (.zip) from:

    http://code.google.com/p/madis/downloads/list

5.  Uncompress above zip file

6.  Use madis by entering into the new "madis/" path and executing "python mterm.py"
